## Reflection Document

### HTML

I felt like everything in the HTML section was pretty simple to figure out. I didn't really struggle with much except for the placekitten and placepuppy sites not working. I feel like these exercises were good to help get introduced to HTML.

### Accessibility

I was able to solve the accesibility issues on my own by using the extension to identify what needed to be fixed. Doing this exercise helped me to see how I can identify accesibility issues with my website.

### CSS

I was able to solve some of them with my notes, and others I looked online or in the videos a bit when I was stuck. I liked the exercises, the media query exercise felt particularly helpful for when wanting to design a responsive layout for a webpage.

### Flexbox / css grid

These sections were really useful for practice with aligning content on websites in different ways. I was able to solve these all on my own through trial and error using the different layout styles and whatnot.

### Bootstrap

Bootstrap was really interesting to learn about and use. It simplifies making useful and good looking elements on a website. I sometimes had to look at the documentation or videos to solve the exercises. I liked learning about the modal elements, it was really simple to make something that feels like it would be really complicated without bootstrap.

### Javascript

I needed to use the videos and/or documentation for most of these to learn about the different tools I was able to use to solve the exercises. The exercises were all good insight into how javascript works. I particularly liked the fetch exercise because I enjoyed learning how to pull data from an api to fill a webpage.
